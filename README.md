Blackjack.py is a fully functional, text-based game played in the Python Console. Playing it does not require the use of any other files.
BlackjackPG.py is a translation of the Blackjack game to PyGame. It is currently a work in progress. 
The Cards directory is just all the card sprites for the BlackjackPG.py game. It is only necessary for that game.
